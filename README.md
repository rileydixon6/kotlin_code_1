# Overview


I wrote a program to print out the date and time and then find the difference between the last date time(last time the program was ran) and the current date time.

In completing this project I had to familiarize myself with Java and many libraries within Java while also learning the kotlin syntax.

To develop this software I used several libraries within Java such as time, and util. I also used IntelliJ as my IDE.
